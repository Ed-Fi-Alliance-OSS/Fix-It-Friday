# Fix It Fridays TOD - Teacher Observation Dashboards

These scripts were made possible thanks to the Ed-Fi Alliance and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.

## Description

This application provides two ETL modules to load Google Form Survey data to the FIF database, and to port data from the ODS data sources to Postgres.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that the following prerequisites are installed on the machine that you are going to run the scripts on.

1. Node Js LTS version https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Postgresql

That is it =)


## Setup Instructions for ETL

1. Download the repository.
2. Setup database using edfi.fif.database if needed (Edit its database.json config file and run `yarn migrate`).
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. To configure the database, rename sample.env to .env and update the values to match your database configuration.

> NOTE: Accepted FIF_SQLSOURCE values match the ./sql subdirectories - ods and amt.


## How to run Survey ETL

For testing with the survey sample data:
    1. Use edfi.fif.etl/surveySampleData/InsertSampleStudentData.sql to insert fif.studentschool
    2. edfi.fif.etl/surveySampleData/* are example csv's to import that have studentkeys references to surveySampleData/InsertSampleStudentData.sql.


```powershell
$ cd edfi.fif.etl
$ node ./src/surveyETL.js ./surveySampleData/InternetAccessSurvey.csv "Internet Access"
```

## How to run Database ETL

The database ETL module (./src/dbETL.js) is executed directly by node. Make sure that followed the steps above to rename sample.env to .env. ALl of this code should be executed in the edfi.fif.etl directory, as shown below.

```powershell
$ cd edfi.fif.etl
$ node ./src/dbETL.js
```
